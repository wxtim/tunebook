<div class="line">Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride</div>
<div class="line">As we went a-walking down by the seaside</div>
<div class="line">Now, mark what followed and what did betide</div>
<div class="line">For it being on Christmas morning…</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Out for recreation, we went on a tramp</div>
<div class="line">And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp</div>
<div class="line">And a little wee drummer, intending to camp</div>
<div class="line">For the day being pleasant and charming</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Good morning ! Good morning!” the sergeant did cry</div>
<div class="line">“And the same to you gentlemen!” we did reply</div>
<div class="line">Intending no harm but meant to pass by</div>
<div class="line">For it being on Christmas morning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But says he, “My fine fellows if you will enlist</div>
<div class="line">It’s ten guineas in gold I will slip in your fist</div>
<div class="line">And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust</div>
<div class="line">And drink the King’s health in the morning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For a soldier he leads a very fine life</div>
<div class="line">And he always is blessed with a charming young wife</div>
<div class="line">And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife</div>
<div class="line">And always lives pleasant and charming…</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And a soldier he always is decent and clean</div>
<div class="line">In the finest of clothing he’s constantly seen</div>
<div class="line">While other poor fellows go dirty and mean</div>
<div class="line">And sup on thin gruel in the morning.”</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“But”, says Arthur, “I wouldn’t be proud of your clothes</div>
<div class="line">For you’ve only the lend of them as I suppose</div>
<div class="line">And you dare not change them one night, for you know</div>
<div class="line">If you do you’ll be flogged in the morning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And although that we are single and free</div>
<div class="line">We take great delight in our own company</div>
<div class="line">And we have no desire strange faces to see</div>
<div class="line">Although that your offers are charming</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And we have no desire to take your advance</div>
<div class="line">All hazards and dangers we barter on chance</div>
<div class="line">For you would have no scruples for to send us to France</div>
<div class="line">Where we would get shot without warning”</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">“Oh now!”, says the sergeant “I’ll have no such chat</div>
<div class="line">And I neither will take it from spalpeen or brat</div>
<div class="line">For if you insult me with one other word</div>
<div class="line">I’ll cut off your heads in the morning”</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And then Arthur and I we soon drew our hods</div>
<div class="line">And we scarce gave them time for to draw their own blades</div>
<div class="line">When a trusty shillelagh came over their heads</div>
<div class="line">And bade them take that as fair warning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their side</div>
<div class="line">We flung them as far as we could in the tide</div>
<div class="line">“Now take them out, Divils!”, cried Arthur McBride</div>
<div class="line">“And temper their edge in the morning”</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And the little wee drummer we flattened his pow</div>
<div class="line">And we made a football of his rowdeydowdow</div>
<div class="line">Threw it in the tide for to rock and to row</div>
<div class="line">And bade it a tedious returning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And we having no money, paid them off in cracks</div>
<div class="line">And we paid no respect to their two bloody backs</div>
<div class="line">For we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks</div>
<div class="line">And left them for dead in the morning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And so to conclude and to finish disputes</div>
<div class="line">We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits</div>
<div class="line">For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts</div>
<div class="line">And bid them look sharp in the morning</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Oh me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride</div>
<div class="line">As we went a walkin’ down by the seaside</div>
<div class="line">Now mark what followed and what did betide</div>
<div class="line">For it being on Christmas morning</div>
</div>
