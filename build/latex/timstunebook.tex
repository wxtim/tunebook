\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
\item[] As we went a\sphinxhyphen{}walking down by the seaside
\item[] Now, mark what followed and what did betide
\item[] For it being on Christmas morning…
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] Out for recreation, we went on a tramp
\item[] And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
\item[] And a little wee drummer, intending to camp
\item[] For the day being pleasant and charming
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] “Good morning ! Good morning!” the sergeant did cry
\item[] “And the same to you gentlemen!” we did reply
\item[] Intending no harm but meant to pass by
\item[] For it being on Christmas morning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] But says he, “My fine fellows if you will enlist
\item[] It’s ten guineas in gold I will slip in your fist
\item[] And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
\item[] And drink the King’s health in the morning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] For a soldier he leads a very fine life
\item[] And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
\item[] And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
\item[] And always lives pleasant and charming…
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And a soldier he always is decent and clean
\item[] In the finest of clothing he’s constantly seen
\item[] While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
\item[] And sup on thin gruel in the morning.”
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] “But”, says Arthur, “I wouldn’t be proud of your clothes
\item[] For you’ve only the lend of them as I suppose
\item[] And you dare not change them one night, for you know
\item[] If you do you’ll be flogged in the morning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And although that we are single and free
\item[] We take great delight in our own company
\item[] And we have no desire strange faces to see
\item[] Although that your offers are charming
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And we have no desire to take your advance
\item[] All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
\item[] For you would have no scruples for to send us to France
\item[] Where we would get shot without warning”
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] “Oh now!”, says the sergeant “I’ll have no such chat
\item[] And I neither will take it from spalpeen or brat
\item[] For if you insult me with one other word
\item[] I’ll cut off your heads in the morning”
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And then Arthur and I we soon drew our hods
\item[] And we scarce gave them time for to draw their own blades
\item[] When a trusty shillelagh came over their heads
\item[] And bade them take that as fair warning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their side
\item[] We flung them as far as we could in the tide
\item[] “Now take them out, Divils!”, cried Arthur McBride
\item[] “And temper their edge in the morning”
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And the little wee drummer we flattened his pow
\item[] And we made a football of his rowdeydowdow
\item[] Threw it in the tide for to rock and to row
\item[] And bade it a tedious returning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
\item[] And we paid no respect to their two bloody backs
\item[] For we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
\item[] And left them for dead in the morning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] And so to conclude and to finish disputes
\item[] We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
\item[] For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
\item[] And bid them look sharp in the morning
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] Oh me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
\item[] As we went a walkin’ down by the seaside
\item[] Now mark what followed and what did betide
\item[] For it being on Christmas morning
