W:Angels from the realms of glory,
W:Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
W:Ye who sang creation's story,
W:Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
W:Watching o'er your flocks by night,
W:God with man is now residing,
W:Yonder shines the infant Light;
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:Sages, leave your contemplations,
W:Brighter visions beam afar;
W:Seek the great desire of nations,
W:Ye have seen His natal star;
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:Saints before the altar bending,
W:Watching long in hope and fear,
W:Suddenly the Lord, descending,
W:In His temple shall appear:
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
