W:On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
W:
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:They looked up and saw a star
W:Shining in the east beyond them far,
W:And to the earth it gave great light,
W:And so it continued both day and night.
W:
W:And by the light of that same star
W:Three wise men came from country far;
W:To seek for a king was their intent,
W:And to follow the star wherever it went.
W:
W:This star drew nigh to the northwest,
W:O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
W:And there it did both stop and stay
W:Right over the place where Jesus lay.
W:
W:Then entered in those wise men three
W:Full reverently upon their knee,
W:and offered there in his presence
W:Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
W:
W:Then let us all with one accord
W:Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;

W:When a poor man came in sight

W:Hither, page, and stand by me,

W:Yonder peasant, who is he?
W:Where and what his dwelling?

W:Underneath the mountain
W:Right against the forest fence
W:By Saint Agnes fountain.

W:Bring me flesh and bring me wine
W:Bring me pine logs hither
W:Thou and I shall see him dine
W:When we bear them thither.
W:Page and monarch, forth they went
W:Forth they went together
W:Through the rude winds wild lament
W:And the bitter weather
W:
W:Sire, the night is darker now
W:And the wind blows stronger
W:Fails my heart, I know not how
W:I can go no longer.
W:Mark my footsteps, good my page
W:Tread thou in them boldly
W:Thou shall find the winters rage
W:Freeze thy blood less coldly.
W:
W:In his masters step he trod
W:Where the snow lay dinted
W:Heat was in the very sod
W:Which the Saint had printed
W:Therefore, Christian men, be sure
W:Wealth or rank possessing
W:Ye, who now will bless the poor
W:Shall yourselves find blessing.
