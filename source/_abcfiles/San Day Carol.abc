W:Now the holly bears a berry as white as the milk
W:And Mary bore Jesus, all wrapp√©d in silk
W:
W:Holly! Holly!
W:And the first tree in the greenwood, it was the holly!
W:
W:And Mary bore Jesus Christ our Saviour for to be,
W:And the first tree in the greenwood, it was the holly.
W:
W:Now the holly bears a berry as green as the grass,
W:And Mary bore Jesus, who died on the cross,
W:
W:Now the holly bears a berry as black as the coal,
W:And Mary bore Jesus, who died for us all,
W:
W:Now the holly bears a berry as blood is it red,
W:And Mary bore Jesus who rose from the dead,
