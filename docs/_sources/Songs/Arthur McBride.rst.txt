| Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
| As we went a-walking down by the seaside
| Now, mark what followed and what did betide
| For it being on Christmas morning...

| Out for recreation, we went on a tramp
| And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
| And a little wee drummer, intending to camp
| For the day being pleasant and charming

| "Good morning ! Good morning!" the sergeant did cry
| "And the same to you gentlemen!" we did reply
| Intending no harm but meant to pass by
| For it being on Christmas morning

| But says he, "My fine fellows if you will enlist
| It's ten guineas in gold I will slip in your fist
| And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
| And drink the King's health in the morning

| For a soldier he leads a very fine life
| And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
| And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
| And always lives pleasant and charming...

| And a soldier he always is decent and clean
| In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
| While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
| And sup on thin gruel in the morning."

| "But", says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
| For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
| And you dare not change them one night, for you know
| If you do you'll be flogged in the morning

| And although that we are single and free
| We take great delight in our own company
| And we have no desire strange faces to see
| Although that your offers are charming

| And we have no desire to take your advance
| All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
| For you would have no scruples for to send us to France
| Where we would get shot without warning"

| "Oh now!", says the sergeant "I'll have no such chat
| And I neither will take it from spalpeen or brat
| For if you insult me with one other word
| I'll cut off your heads in the morning"

| And then Arthur and I we soon drew our hods
| And we scarce gave them time for to draw their own blades
| When a trusty shillelagh came over their heads
| And bade them take that as fair warning

| And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their side
| We flung them as far as we could in the tide
| "Now take them out, Divils!", cried Arthur McBride
| "And temper their edge in the morning"

| And the little wee drummer we flattened his pow
| And we made a football of his rowdeydowdow
| Threw it in the tide for to rock and to row
| And bade it a tedious returning

| And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
| And we paid no respect to their two bloody backs
| For we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
| And left them for dead in the morning

| And so to conclude and to finish disputes
| We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
| For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
| And bid them look sharp in the morning

| Oh me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
| As we went a walkin' down by the seaside
| Now mark what followed and what did betide
| For it being on Christmas morning
